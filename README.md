# Using OpenStreetMap data in QGIS

Presentation by Keith Jenkins at [FOSS4GNA 2018 St. Louis](https://2018.foss4g-na.org/session/using-openstreetmap-data-qgis)

Over the years, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has established itself as the most
complete global dataset of road data, as well as a great source for other
features like building outlines and points of interest. Its open data license
has allowed third-party developers to create numerous tools for extracting,
processing, and repackaging OSM data in a variety of formats. But with so
many options, it can be difficult to keep up as new tools are created, and
others are retired.

This talk will give an overview of the many different ways to acquire and use
OSM data within QGIS. We'll explore different sources and formats of OSM data
extracts, and why you might choose one over another. We'll investigate the
mystery of what happens to all those OSM tags during the conversion process.
We'll discover some ready-made QGIS styles that can be used to render
beautiful OSM data. We'll see various designs of pre-rendered OSM-based map
tiles that can be used as base layers in QGIS. And we'll assess the current
state of OSM-related plugins for QGIS 2 and QGIS 3.
